******************
Le_CARL_client_2.0
******************

Eclipse project (java): Client app running on Android phone.
- requires Android 4.0 or higher.
- requires opencv 2.4.5 for Android.
- requires the IOIO libraries.


******************
Le_CARL_PC_Server
******************

QT (c++) project: Server running on PC.
- requires QT libraries.
- I also recommand using QT Creator (IDE) to open the project if you need to change the GUI.
Both Qt libraries and Qt Creator can be downloaded in one package here: http://qt-project.org/downloads


******************
Once everything is installed and compiled:
- start server on PC
- start and connect Android client to the server using the IP address of server (port 9000).
- once connected, you should see an Android icon on the server GUI.
- right click on it to open a window from which you can start/stop the camera, sensors and IOIO.
